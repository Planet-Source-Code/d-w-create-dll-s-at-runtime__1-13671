Instructions for putting a .dll  in a resource file

1. Copy the .dll to the directory containing the 
Resource project. This folder also must include rc.exe
and rcdll.dll. This folder may be named Resource.

2. Run the project and select the .dll from the common
dialog.

3. After Dll.res is created, copy it to your project
directory and add it to your project from the 
Project/Add File menu option. 

Limitations: 

1. You can only have one resource file in a VB project.

2. Using this method you can only have one file in the
resource file. To add several files you would need to 
create the Dll.rc file manually.

3. May be a size limitation but it is not the 64K limit
referred to in VB help.

4. This is an example program only that works here and
may not work in other cases.

5. DOS sometimes gets paths confused.
