## Create Dll's at Runtime


</div>

### Description

Here is a VB wrapper for RC.exe, the DOS resource file

compiler, that allows you to put a .dll into a resource

file and compile it into an executable making it more or

less stand-alone. Included is a useful sample project

that contains a .dll and some code written by Catalin

Petolea (Mancubus), birkhoffs@hotmail.com. This sample

shows how to create the dll in the Form_Load from the

.exe and also has a CPU information module that can very

easily be dropped into any project. It returns a concise

string containing most information on CPU's.
